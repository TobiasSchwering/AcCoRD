// WARNING: THIS IS NOT A REAL CONFIGURATION FILE!!!
// THE "COMMENTS" IN THIS FILE MAKE IT INVALID JSON!
// BUT ... THIS FILE DESCRIBES HOW TO WRITE A VALID CONFIGURATION FILE
//
// With that out of the way, welcome to this "tutorial" for preparing proper
// AcCoRD configuration files.
//
// This document is current as of v0.4 (2016-02-12).
//
// Please note that valid configuration files cannot have these comments
// preceded by "//". If you remove these comments and place a copy of
// this file in the "config" folder, then you can run it in AcCoRD.
// However, this should be unnecessary since the config folder includes
// a number of sample valid configuration files.
// Please refer to README.txt for instructions on running a simulation.
//
// AcCoRD input and summary output files use the JSON format. JSON stands for
// JavaScript Object Notation and it is defined at json.org.
// JSON is a way of organizing data into an object.
//
// AcCoRD requires that names (i.e., the words between double quotes
// and before a colon, e.g., "Output Filename") MUST be written EXACTLY as they are
// in this file. These names are hard-coded into AcCoRD.
//
// Except where noted, ALL names are mandatory in a configuration file, though some of them may have
// an empty value associated with them. In particular, "Chemical Reaction Specification"
// is an empty array if there are no chemical reactions to simulate.
//
// The ORDER of name/value pairs does not matter for it to be parsed correctly,
// but the NESTING does. So, for example, you can swap the order of "Output Filename"
// and "Simulation Control", but "Number of Repeats" must be defined inside the
// "Simulation Control" object.
//
// An object is encapsulated inside curly braces {}. A configuration file has one top-level
// object and a number of nested objects. An array is encapsulated inside square brackets [].
// The items in an object are name/value pairs, but the items in an array do not have
// associated names. Items are separated with commas.
//
// Extra white spaces are ignored.
//
// Read below to see a description of the individual parameters

		// Generally, a seed value initializes a RNG. Running the same
		// simulation twice with the same random number seed will produce identical results
		// in the corresponding realizations (i.e., the first realization in each output file
		// will be the same, and the second realization in each output file will be the same, etc).
		// AcCoRD uses explicit seeds (instead of random seeds) for 2 reasons:
		// 1) all results are re-producable
		// 2) by specifying different seeds for different executions of the same simulation,
		// the simulations can be executed on different machines and the output files aggregated
		// without needing to worry about the simulations having the same output.
